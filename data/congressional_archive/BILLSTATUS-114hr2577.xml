          <text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</p> <p><b>Highlights: </b></p> <p>The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides FY2016 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and several related agencies. </p> <p>The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Funding from the HTF is contingent on the enactment of a new authorization bill. </p> <p>The bill increases overall funding for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies above FY2015 levels.
