Interior, upon determining that a project can be expedited by a nonfederal sponsor and that there is a demonstrable federal interest in expediting the project, shall advance it as a nonfederal project.</p> <p>A federal jurisdictional agency must complete any required approval or decision for the environmental review process on an expeditious basis. If the agency fails to render a decision relating to a project study that requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment, the amount of funds made available to support the office of the head of the agency shall be reduced by specified amounts that must be transferred to the division of the agency charged with rendering the decision. Agencies must notify Congress of the amounts of such transfers and describe the decisions and project studies involved.</p> <p>Interior shall: (1) survey the use by Reclamation of categorical exclusions in projects since 2005 and propose a new categorical exclusion for a category of activities if merited, and (2) establish a program to measure and report on progress made toward improving and expediting the planning and environmental review process.</p> <p>(Sec. 146) Interior must develop and submit annually a Report to Congress on Future Water Project Development that identifies: (1) the costs and benefits of, the nonfederal interests associated with, and the support for project reports, proposed project studies, and proposed modifications to authorized water projects and project studies that are related to Reclamation's missions and authorities, that require specific congressional authorization, that have not been congressionally authorized, that have not been included in any previous annual report, and that, if authorized, could be carried out by Reclamation; and (2) any project study that was expedited under this subtitle.</p> <p>TITLE II--PROTECTING EXISTING WATER RIGHTS</p> <p><em>Water Rights Protection Act</em></p> <p>(Sec. 204) This title prohibits USDA or Interior from conditioning or withholding an action to issue, renew, amend, or extend any permit, approval, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement on:</p> <ul> <li>the transfer of any state water right to the United States or any other designee; </li> <li>the acquisition of a state water right in the name of the United States; </li> <li>limiting the date, time, quantity, location of diversion or pumping, or place of use of a state water right beyond any applicable limitations under state water law; or </li> <li>the modification of the terms and conditions of groundwater withdrawal, guidance and reporting procedures, and conservation and source protection measures established by a state. </li></ul> <p>(Sec. 205) In developing any rule, policy, directive, or management plan relating to such an action, Interior or USDA: (1) shall recognize the long-standing authority of the states relating to groundwater and coordinate with the states to ensure that any such rule, policy, directive, or management plan is consistent with, and imposes no greater restriction or regulatory requirement than, applicable state groundwater law; and (2) shall not assert any connection between surface and groundwater that is inconsistent with such a connection recognized by state water laws or adversely affect any authority of a state in adjudicating water rights, any definition established by a state with respect to the term "beneficial use," "priority of water rights," or "terms of use," or any other right or obligation of a state established under state law.</p> <p>TITLE III-- COMPLETING AND MAINTAINING RURAL WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE </p> <p>Subtitle A--Irrigation Rehabilitation and Renovation for Indian Tribal Governments and Economies</p> <p><em>Irrigation Rehabilitation and Renovation for Indian Tribal Governments and Their Economies Act or the IRRIGATE Act</em></p> <p>Part I--Indian Irrigation Fund </p> <p>(Sec. 311) This part establishes the Indian Irrigation Fund (IIF), from which Interior may make expenditures to carry out this subtitle. </p> <p>(Sec. 312) The Department of the Treasury shall deposit into the IIF for each of FY2017-FY2038 specified amounts of revenues that would otherwise be deposited in the reclamation fund established by the Reclamation Act of 1902. </p> <p>(Sec. 313) The part sets forth requirements for IIF expenditures, investments, and transfers. </p> <p>(Sec. 315) The IIF shall terminate on September 30, 2038, and the unexpended and unobligated balance shall be transferred to the reclamation fund.</p> <p>PART II--Repair, Replacement, and Maintenance of Certain Indian Irrigation Projects</p> <p>(Sec. 321) Interior shall establish a program to address the deferred maintenance and water storage needs of Indian irrigation projects that: (1) create risks to public or employee safety or natural or cultural resources, and (2) unduly impede the management and efficiency of the Indian irrigation program.</p> <p>Interior shall use or transfer specified amounts in the IIF to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for each of FY2017-FY2038 to carry out maintenance, repair, replacement, and water storage construction activities for Indian irrigation projects in the western United States that are owned by the federal government and managed and operated by the BIA and that have deferred maintenance documented. Such amounts shall not be: (1) subject to reimbursement by the owners of the land served by the Indian irrigation projects; or (2) assessed as debts or liens against the land served by such projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 323) Interior shall submit to Congress: (1) programmatic goals to carry out this part that would enable the completion of repairing, replacing, modernizing, or performing maintenance on projects as expeditiously as possible, facilitate or improve the BIA's ability to carry out its mission in operating a project, ensure that the results of government-to-government consultation with the Indian tribe that has jurisdiction over the land on which an eligible project is located are addressed, and facilitate the construction of new water storage using nonfederal contributions to address tribal, regional, and watershed-level supply needs; and (2) funding prioritization criteria to serve as a methodology for distributing funds under this part. Such criteria must take into account:</p> <ul> <li>the extent to which deferred maintenance of projects threatens public or employee safety or health, natural or cultural resources, or the BIA's ability to operate the project; </li> <li>the methodology of the rehabilitation priority index; </li> <li>the potential economic benefits of the expenditures on job creation and general economic development in the affected tribal communities; and </li> <li>the ability of the qualifying project to address tribal, regional, and watershed level water supply needs. </li></ul> <p>(Sec. 324) Interior shall: (1) complete a study that evaluates options for improving programmatic and project management and performance of irrigation projects managed and operated by the BIA, and (2) submit status reports biennially on progress made and deficiencies remaining regarding addressing the deferred maintenance needs of Indian irrigation projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 325) Before expending funds on an Indian irrigation project under this part, Interior must consult with Indian tribes with jurisdiction over the land and solicit input from landowners served by the project and irrigators from adjacent irrigation districts. </p> <p>(Sec. 326) Interior shall ensure that, for each of FY2017-FY2038, each eligible Indian irrigation project that has critical maintenance needs receives funding. </p> <p>In allocating funding under this bill, Interior: (1) shall give priority to projects serving more than one Indian tribe within an Indian reservation and to projects for which funding has not been made available during the previous 10 years under any other Act of Congress that expressly addresses the deferred maintenance, repair, or replacement needs of such project; and (2) shall not provide more than a specified amount to any individual project during any consecutive 3-year period.</p> <p>Subtitle B--Clean Water for Rural Communities</p> <p><em>Clean Water for Rural Communities Act</em></p> <p>(Sec. 334) This subtitle authorizes Interior to carry out water supply projects in Montana and North Dakota entitled: (1) the "Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System" in accordance with the Dry-Redwater Regional Water System Feasibility Study, which received funding from Reclamation on September 1, 2010; and (2) the "Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System" in accordance with the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System Feasibility Report. </p> <p>Interior shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority (DRWA) and the Central Montana Regional Water Authority to provide federal assistance for the planning, design, and construction of such water systems. The bill sets forth the federal share of such costs and the authorized uses of federal funds, which exclude operation, maintenance, or replacement of the water systems.</p> <p>(Sec. 335) The Western Area Power Administration shall make available to the Dry-Redwater System a quantity of power (up to one and a half megawatt capacity) required to meet the system's pumping and incidental operation requirements between May 1 and October 31 of each year: (1) from the water intake facilities; and (2) through all pumping stations, water treatment facilities, reservoirs, storage tanks, and pipelines up to the point of delivery of water to all storage reservoirs and tanks and each entity that distributes water at retail to individual users. </p> <p>The Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System shall be eligible to receive such power only if it: (1) operates on a nonprofit basis, and (2) is constructed pursuant to Interior's cooperative agreement with DRWA. </p> <p>DRWA shall be responsible for: (1) charges for additional power needed to meet pumping requirements, (2) the costs of nonfederal transmission and distribution system delivery and service arrangements, and (3) funding any upgrades to the transmission system owned by the Western Area Power Administration Basin Electric Power District and the Heartland Consumers Power District required to deliver power to the system.</p> <p>TITLE IV--OFFSET</p> <p><em>Accelerated Revenue, Repayment, and Surface Water Storage Enhancement Act</em></p> <p>(Sec. 401) This title requires Interior, upon request from a water users association, to convert certain water service contracts between the United States and the association to allow for prepayment of repayment contracts. </p>]]></text>
