          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Department of State Operations Authorization and Embassy Security Act, Fiscal Year 2016</strong></p> <p>TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AUTHORITIES AND ACTIVITIES</p> <p>This bill directs the Department of State (Department) to report to Congress regarding: </p> <ul> <li>Department costs incurred to provide American Spaces; </li> <li>the status of all ongoing investment treaty negotiations; </li> <li>conditions in Hong Kong of interest to the United States, and whether Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is sufficiently autonomous to justify different treatment for its citizens from the treatment accorded to other citizens of China; </li> <li>civil or political rights violations against ethnic, racial, or religious minorities in Burma (Myanmar);</li> <li>efforts to ensure the peaceful resolution of Venezuela's political situation; </li> <li> the sale of defense articles and defense services to Ukraine;</li> <li>the debt environment for developing countries and near-term risks to debt sustainability;</li> <li>country reports on corruption practices;</li> <li>cases of enforced disappearances in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; </li> <li>Bahrain's implementation of the recommendations in the 2011 Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry;</li> <li>known or suspected penetrations or compromises of Department information systems or networks; </li> <li>efforts to promote equal opportunity for all American employees in direct hire and personal service contractors status, particularly Foreign Service employees;</li> <li> activities at the United Nations (U.N.) and its subagencies that can be construed to exhibit an anti-Semitic bias; </li> <li> evaluation and prioritization of current U.N. peacekeeping missions;</li> <li>U.S. citizen staffing at international organizations that includes an assessment of U.S. representation among professional and senior-level positions at the U.N. and its specialized agencies;</li> <li>enhancement of the Marine Corps Security Guard program;</li> <li>high risk, high threat overseas posts; </li> <li>counterintelligence threats to U.S. diplomatic facilities in Priority 1 Counterintelligence Threat Nations; and </li> <li>the status of post-earthquake recovery and development efforts in Haiti. </li> </ul> <p>The President shall designate an existing federal officer as the Interagency Hostage Recovery Coordinator to coordinate efforts to secure the release of U.S. persons held hostage outside the United States. </p> <p>The Department shall conduct a review of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue. </p> <p>Funds are made available to support efforts by American and European Jewish and other civil society organizations to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of religious, ethnic, or racial intolerance in Europe.</p> <p>The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979 is amended to authorize the Department to provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements for science and technology fellowship programs.</p> <p>The Department is authorized to provide for U.S. participation in the Information Sharing Centre in Singapore. </p> <p>The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to revise reporting requirements concerning the importation of rough diamonds into the United States not controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.</p> <p> It is the sense of Congress that: </p> <ul> <li>the alliance between the United States and Japan is a cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world; and </li> <li>the United States and Japan oppose the use of coercion or force to change the status quo, including in the East and South China Seas.</li> </ul> <p>It is the sense of Congress that the United States should: </p> <ul> <li>expand defense cooperation with India, and </li> <li>welcome India's role in providing security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.</li> </ul> <p>It is the sense of Congress that: </p> <ul> <li>the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance has served as an anchor for security and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asia-Pacific region, and around the world; and </li> <li>the United States and the Republic of Korea share concerns that the nuclear, cyber, and ballistic missiles programs of North Korea and its repeated provocations threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. </li> </ul> <p> It is the sense of Congress that: </p> <ul> <li>U.S. policy toward Taiwan is based upon the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances given by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, </li> <li>provision of defensive weapons to Taiwan should continue, and </li> <li>enhanced trade relations with Taiwan should be pursued. </li> </ul> <p>The Department shall: </p> <ul> <li>develop a Middle East strategy in the event of a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran, and </li> <li>produce a comprehensive strategy relating to U.S. international cyberspace policy. </li> </ul> <p>The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to declare that, if an immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, 2013, for a child who has been lawfully adopted, or who is coming to the United States to be adopted by a U.S. citizen, any statutory immigrant visa fees relating to renewal or replacement of such visa may be waived or refunded under specified circumstances.</p> <p>It is the sense of Congress that ensuring justice for U.S. victims of Iranian acts of terrorism who hold related legal judgments against Iran should be expeditiously addressed. </p> <p>The American Hostages in Iran Compensation Fund is established in the Treasury. </p> <p>Congress: </p> <ul> <li>supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of post-Soviet countries within their internationally recognized borders;
