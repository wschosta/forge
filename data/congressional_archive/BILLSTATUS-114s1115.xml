Requires each federal agency head that manages a covered grant account recommended for closure in such report&nbsp;to close such account not later than 180 days after&nbsp;the report is submitted. <br /></p> <p>Defines "covered grant account" as a grant account in a federal agency payment management system that has a zero balance for more than 180 days and for which the grant award period has expired.&nbsp;</p>]]></text>
