Sets forth exceptions from new drug requirements, biological product requirements, labeling requirements, and good manufacturing practice requirements for a drug that: (1) is compounded by a traditional compounder, and (2) meets applicable requirements.</p> <p>Defines &ldquo;traditional compounder&rdquo; as a facility operating pursuant to state law that meets certain criteria, including that a drug is compounded by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician pursuant to a prescription order for an identified individual patient or compounded in limited qualities before a prescription order based on history of receiving such prescription orders. Includes as a traditional compounder hospitals and health systems (collection of hospitals) that compound drugs only to dispense or administer them to patients of the hospital or health system.</p> <p> Exempts from labeling requirements, new drug requirements and biological product requirements a compounded prescription drug that: (1) is compounded by a compounding manufacturer that is not licensed as a pharmacy in any state but is in compliance with this Act, and (2) meets the applicable requirements for drugs compounded by a compounding manufacturer.</p> <p>Defines &ldquo;compounding manufacturer&rdquo; as a facility at one geographic location or address that: (1) compounds any sterile drug without receiving a prescription order for an identified individual patient before beginning compounding, and distributes or offers to sell such compounded sterile drug in interstate commerce; or (2) repackages any preservative-free sterile drug or engages in sterile pooling.
