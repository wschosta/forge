It also requires the President to report on how this authority fits within a larger regional strategy. The amendment allows the Department of Defense (DOD) to submit a reprogramming request to Congress should the President request DOD funds to execute this authority and permit the Secretary of Defense to accept foreign contributions.</purpose>
