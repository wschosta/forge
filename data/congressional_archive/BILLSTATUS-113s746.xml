          <text><![CDATA[<p>Amends the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), for each of the 2014-2018 crops of each market commodity, to make recourse loans available to producers on a farm electing to participate in the program. </p> <p>Sets forth: (1) the recourse loan rate for corn, oats, barley, grain sorghum, wheat, and soybeans; and (2) market commodity-specific limitations on participation (inventory caps) for such crops.</p> <p>Requires participating producers, until the Secretary authorizes loan repayment and release, to: (1) store and maintain the market commodity, and (2) not sell or otherwise release the commodity into the market.</p> <p>Provides that during such storage period: (1) title to the commodity shall remain with the producers, and (2) the Secretary shall have a first lien on the commodity for which a recourse loan is received.</p> <p>Provides USDA payments to producers at $0.40 per bushel per crop year. </p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to establish a partial commodity release if the market release of all of the stored commodity would depress prices below the release level.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to establish a set-aside program under which qualifying producers on a farm may remove acres from production for the following crop year if the inventory cap for a commodity is reached and such commodity's market price is below the recourse loan rate. Requires participating producers to maintain a cover crop on all enrolled acreage.</p>]]></text>
