        <text>Floor summary: DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Gallego motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to provide a 2.3% pay increase for fiscal year 2016 for members of the uniformed services.
