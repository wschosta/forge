        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Neal motion to recommit with instructions, pending reservation of a point order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to deny any "inverted" corporations that change their residence from the United States in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes from receiving the tax benefits made available in the underlying legislation. Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>
