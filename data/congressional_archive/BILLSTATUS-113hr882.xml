          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2013 - (Sec. 2) States that it is the policy of the U.S. government that no government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or business entities with seriously delinquent federal tax debts. </p> <p>(Sec. 3) Requires the head of any executive agency that issues an invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (i.e., $150,000) to require each person submitting a bid or proposal to: (1) certify that such person does not have a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose information limited to describing whether such person has a seriously delinquent tax debt.</p> <p>Requires the head of any executive agency: (1) in evaluating any offer received in response to an agency solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract, to consider a certification that the offeror has a seriously delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof that the offeror is not a responsible source to do business with the federal government; and (2) to propose an offeror or a grant applicant for debarment after receiving an offer for a contract or grant application that contains a certification that such person has a seriously delinquent tax debt, or after receiving information from the Secretary that a submitted certification is false. Allows a waiver of such debarment requirement if an agency head certifies in writing urgent and compelling circumstances significantly affecting the interests of the United States.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) Requires the head of any executive agency that offers a grant in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold amount to require each grant applicant to: (1) certify that the applicant does not have a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorize the Secretary to disclose information limited to describing whether such a applicant has a seriously delinquent tax debt. Requires the agency head, in evaluating a grant application, to consider a certification that the grant applicant has a seriously delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof that the applicant is high-risk, requiring enhanced oversight. </p> <p>Requires the revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to incorporate requirements set forth in this Act relating to responsibility determinations and debarment for offerors or grant applicants. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) Defines "seriously delinquent tax debt" as an outstanding tax debt for which a notice of lien has been filed in public records.
