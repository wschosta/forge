          <text><![CDATA[<p>Strengthening America's Schools Act of 2013 - Revises and reauthorizes programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA).</p> <p> <strong>Title I: College and Career Readiness for All Students - </strong>Amends title I of the ESEA to revise the school improvement program under part A. </p> <p>Eliminates the requirement that local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools make adequate yearly progress toward state academic performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring.</p> <p>Requires states to adopt college and career ready academic content and achievement standards and assessments in reading, mathematics, science, and English language proficiency. </p> <p>Requires states to adopt and implement assessments of student achievement and academic growth toward those standards that: (1) measure the overall performance of students in each public school; and (2) allow for the disaggregation of the results by gender, each major racial and ethnic group, English proficiency status, migrant status, status as a student with a disability, and economically disadvantaged status. </p> <p>Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. </p> <p>Allows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments that measure student growth above or below grade level. </p> <p>Directs states that use school improvement funds to support early childhood education to establish, or certify the existence of, early learning guidelines for preschool-aged children and early grade standards for children in kindergarten through grade three.</p> <p>Requires states to establish annual performance targets for LEAs and elementary and secondary schools that include targets for student proficiency, academic growth, English language proficiency for English learners, and high school graduation rates.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to ensure that each school that, after two consecutive years, has not met state performance targets for the same student subgroup develops and implements a locally designed intervention to improve student achievement in that subgroup.</p> <p>Subjects schools to improvement strategies if they are identified as: (1) focus schools due to their having among the largest achievement or graduation gaps among student subgroups in the state; or (2) priority schools due to their status as the lowest achieving schools in the state, high schools with graduation rates below 60%, or focus schools for the six preceding consecutive years. </p> <p>Requires each LEA that serves a focus school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their priority schools and use it to select and implement, as appropriate for each school: (1) a transformation strategy, (2) a turnaround strategy, (3) a whole school reform strategy, (4) a restart strategy, or (5) a school closure strategy.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to allow students at priority schools to transfer to another of its public schools that has not been identified as a priority school, unless that option is prohibited by state law. </p> <p>Repeals the School Support and Recognition program.</p> <p>Requires teachers teaching a core academic subject in a program supported with school improvement funds to be highly qualified and certified to teach that subject area, but makes this requirement applicable only to new teachers if the state has fully implemented a professional growth and improvement system.</p> <p> Requires LEAs to show that: (1) combined state and local per-pupil expenditures in each of their schools served under part A are not less than the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for their schools not served under part A; or (2) the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures at its high-poverty schools are no less than those expenditures at its low-poverty schools, if LEAs serve all of their schools under part A.</p> <p> Establishes the Blue Ribbon Schools program that allows states to award their highest performing schools with increased autonomy, flexibility in using ESEA funds, and monetary rewards.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary of Education, acting jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), to designate exemplary early childhood education programs as centers of excellence in early childhood and award each of them a bonus grant to improve the quality of their program and others in their region.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to identify and recognize exemplary schools, programs, and individuals.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to award grants to states to develop, improve, or administer their college and career ready academic standards and assessments. </p> <p> Replaces part B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants) of title I with new Pathways to College grant programs that: (1) assist schools in implementing innovative and effective secondary school reform strategies, and (2) cover part or all of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination fee low-income students incur.</p> <p>Amends the program, under part C (Education of Migratory Children), providing grants to states for the education of migratory children. Requires migratory children to be given the opportunity to meet the same college and career readiness standards as other children.</p> <p> Amends part D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk). Requires states to ensure that students who have been placed in the juvenile justice system are promptly re-enrolled in secondary school or placed in re-entry programs that best meet their educational and social needs. Includes at-risk Indian children and youth in the program.</p> <p>Replaces part E (National Assessment of Subchapter I) with a new part E (Educational Stability of Children in Foster Care) program to facilitate the educational transition of children that move to a new school attendance area as the result of being placed in foster care, changing their foster care placement, or leaving foster care.</p> <p> Eliminates parts F (Comprehensive School Reform), G (Advanced Placement Programs), and H (School Dropout Prevention).</p> <p><strong>Title II: Supporting Teacher and Principal Excellence - </strong>Replaces title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) with a new title II (Supporting Teacher and Principal Excellence).

Requires English learners (currently referred to as limited English proficient students) to be tested against those proficiency standards on an annual basis.</p> <p>Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Requires the decision about which students should be measured against these standards to be made separately for each student in each subject assessed. Prohibits the number of students in a state who are being assessed in each grade level for each subject using the alternate assessment from exceeding 1% of the number of all students in that grade level in the state being assessed in that subject matter. </p> <p>Directs states that use school improvement funds to support early childhood education to establish, or certify the existence of, early learning guidelines for preschool-aged children and early grade standards for children in kindergarten through grade three by the close of 2015.</p> <p>Requires states, by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, to adopt and implement statewide assessments that measure student achievement against: (1) the reading or language arts and mathematics standards annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during grades 10 through 12; and (2) the science standards at least once in grades 3 through 5, 6 through 9, and 10 through 12; (3) the English language proficiency standards; and (4) any alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. </p> <p>Requires the assessments in reading or language arts, mathematics, and science to: (1) measure whether each student is performing at the student's grade level, (2) determine the specific grade level at which each student is performing, and (3) measure each student's academic growth.</p> <p>Allows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments for those subjects.</p> <p>Allows the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics to be administered through a single annual summative assessment or through multiple assessments during an academic year, provided the multiple assessments yield a summative score that reliably measures student academic growth.</p> <p>Requires states to reduce duplicative assessments. </p> <p>Requires each state receiving part A funds to prepare and disseminate an annual report card on the performance of each public elementary and secondary school in the state, each local educational agency (LEA) in the state, and the state as a whole. Requires the report cards to include: (1) specified student information in the aggregate and disaggregated and cross-tabulated by student subgroup, (2) class size information, (3) information on each school's categorization under the state accountability system, (4) school sports information, and (5) information on the number of students using early intervening services.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to issue report cards that contain specified student information disaggregated by student subgroup.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to provide parents with an equity report card for each school that includes: (1) student achievement data, disaggregated by student subgroup; (2) information on the school's funding by source; (3) for each high school, the graduation rate and the rate students enroll in college; (4) information on student participation in educational opportunities at the school; and (5) school climate information.</p> <p>(Sec. 1113) Alters the formula LEAs are to use to: (1) rank the poverty of school attendance areas if school improvement funds are insufficient to serve all areas, and (2) calculate the number of low-income students in secondary schools. </p> <p>Requires LEAs to reserve part A funds to serve homeless and foster care children. Allows reserved funds to be used to provide homeless children and youth with services not ordinarily provided to other children under part A.</p> <p>(Sec. 1114) Amends provisions concerning schoolwide programs (programs that allow LEAs to consolidate school improvement funds to upgrade the entire educational program of schools) to allow the delivery of those programs by external providers that have expertise in using scientifically valid strategies and programs to improve teaching, learning, and schools.</p> <p>Requires schoolwide programs to include reform strategies that provide: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting low-performing or at-risk children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards.</p> <p>(Sec. 1115) Allows targeted assistance programs (programs that direct school improvement funds toward the children in a school who are failing or most at risk of failing) to include: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) support for programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting those children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards.</p> <p>(Sec. 1116) Eliminates the requirement that LEAs and their elementary and secondary schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires, instead, that each state accountability system: </p> <ul> <li> establish annual performance targets for the state and its LEAs and elementary and secondary schools that include targets for student proficiency, academic growth, English language proficiency for English learners, and high school graduation rates; </li> <li> use the assessments and high school graduation rates to annually measure and report on the performance of the state's elementary and secondary schools and LEAs; and </li> <li>require the improvement, through supports and interventions that address student needs, of all of the state's public schools that are low-performing or have low-performing subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students.</li> </ul> <p>Requires state accountability systems to include student performance in reading or language arts and mathematics. Allows states to include other subjects, such as science, for which they have adopted academic content and achievement standards.</p> <p>Requires LEAs to ensure that each school that, after two consecutive years, has not met state performance targets for the same student subgroup develops and implements a locally designed intervention to improve student achievement in that subgroup.</p> <p>Subjects schools to improvement strategies if they are identified as: (1) focus schools due to their having among the largest achievement or graduation gaps among student subgroups in the state; or (2) priority schools due to their status as the lowest achieving schools in the state, high schools with graduation rates below 60%, or focus schools for the six preceding consecutive years. </p> <p>Identifies a school as a focus school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it is not identified as a priority school and is in the 10% of all: (1) public schools in the state with the greatest achievement gaps among the subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students; or (2) public high schools in the state with the greatest graduation rate gaps among those student subgroups.</p> <p>Requires each LEA that serves a focus school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups.</p> <p>Continues a focus school's characterization as a focus school for the three years following its designation as such, unless it meets all of its performance targets or the state determines, after the second year, that it will meet those targets by the end of the following year.</p> <p>Allows states to apply to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as focus schools if they determine that all of their schools that would be identified as such are performing at a satisfactory level.</p> <p>Identifies a school as a priority school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it: (1) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary schools in the state, (2) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of secondary schools in the state, (3) is a public high school with a graduation rate of less than 60%, or (4) has been a focus school for the six preceding consecutive years.</p> <p>Allows states to apply to the Secretary for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as priority schools due to their being within the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary or 5% of secondary schools if they determine that all of those schools are performing at a satisfactory level.</p> <p>Authorizes a state, state law permitting, to take over a school and act as its LEA if the school has been identified as a priority school for the initial three-year identification period and is then re-identified as a priority school for a subsequent three-year period.</p> <p>Requires LEAs receiving part A funds to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their priority schools and use it to select and implement the most appropriate school improvement strategy to improve student performance at each school. </p> <p>Requires LEAs that are implementing any of the school improvement strategies to provide: (1) school staff with ongoing training and performance evaluations; (2) students with instruction and instructional supports that meet their individual needs; and (3) the school with assistance in implementing positive behavioral interventions and supports, other early intervening services, and school based mental-health programs.</p> <p>Identifies the school improvement strategies as: (1) the transformation strategy, (2) the turnaround strategy, (3) the whole school reform strategy, (4) the restart strategy, and (5) the school closure strategy.</p> <p>Includes as part of the transformation strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) requiring instructional and leadership personnel to reapply for their positions; (3) requiring hiring at the school to be done through mutual consent; and (4) implementing schedules and strategies that provide increased learning time.</p> <p> Includes as part of the turnaround strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) screening all teachers in the school and retaining not more than 65% of them; and (3) implementing schedules and strategies the provide increased learning time.</p> <p>Identifies the whole school reform strategy as one undertaken in partnership with an external provider offering a school reform program that is based on at least a moderate level of evidence that it will have a statistically significant effect on student outcomes.</p> <p> Includes as part of the restart strategy: (1) converting the school into a public charter, magnet, or innovative school; (2) allowing students of the former school to enroll in the new school; and (3) using a random lottery system to admit additional students if the new school has more applicants than it can accommodate.</p> <p>Requires LEAs implementing the school closure strategy to enroll students who attended the closed school in higher-performing schools that are within reasonable proximity to the closed school. Allows school improvement funds to be used to support the costs the higher-performing schools incur in meeting the needs of these new students.</p> <p> Allows states, with the Secretary's approval, to establish an alternative state-determined, evidence-based, school improvement strategy to be used by their LEAs, but prohibits funds under title I of the ESEA from being used for school vouchers.</p> <p>Continues a priority school's characterization as a priority school for the three years following its designation as such, unless, after the second year, it has met all of its performance targets or the state determines that it will meet those targets by the end of the following year. </p> <p>Requires LEAs to: (1) implement the restart or school closure strategy for schools that are re-classified as priority schools after their initial classification as such; and (2) allow students at priority schools to transfer to another public school that has not been identified as persistently low-achieving, unless that option is prohibited by state law.</p> <p>(Sec. 1117) Repeals the school support and recognition program (a program that requires states to establish a statewide system of intensive and sustained support and improvement for LEAs and schools to increase the opportunity for students to meet the state's academic content and student academic achievement standards).</p> <p>Requires teachers teaching a core academic subject in a program supported with school improvement funds to be highly qualified and certified to teach that subject area, but makes this requirement applicable only to new teachers if the state has fully implemented a professional growth and improvement system.</p> <p>Allows LEAs that are unable to provide a small, rural, or remote school with a highly-qualified, on-site, classroom teacher for a core academic subject to use distance education provided by a teacher highly qualified in the subject, but only if a teacher highly qualified in another subject is present in the classroom to assist students during the distance education.</p> <p>Excepts teachers of American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian language, culture, or history from the requirement that teachers be highly qualified.
