          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nuclear Terrorism Conventions Implementation and Safety of Maritime Navigation Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>Amends the federal criminal code to expand provisions against violence against maritime navigation by prohibiting the use against or on a ship, or the discharge from a ship, of any explosive or radioactive material, biological, chemical, or nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive device in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury or damage, the discharge from a ship of oil, liquefied natural gas, or other hazardous or noxious material that causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury or damage, or the use of a ship in a manner that causes death or serious injury or damage, when the purpose of such an act is to intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do, or to abstain from doing, any act. Prohibits: (1) transporting on board a ship any prohibited material knowing that it is intended to be used to cause, or in a threat to cause, death or serious injury or damage; or (2) transporting another person on board who has committed an offense against maritime navigation. Imposes similar prohibitions against violence against maritime fixed platforms. </p> <p>Authorizes: (1) civil forfeiture of any real or personal property used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of a maritime navigation offense; and (2) the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications in the investigation of maritime navigation and maritime fixed platform offenses and acts of nuclear terrorism. </p> <p>Imposes a prison term against any person who knowingly and unlawfully: (1) possesses radioactive material or makes or possesses a device with the intent to cause death, serious bodily injury, or substantial damage to property or the environment; or (2) uses such material or device in a manner that causes the release of, or increases the risk of release of, radioactive material to cause death or damage or to compel a person, an international organization, or a county to do or refrain from doing an act. Prohibits threats and attempts or conspiracies to use radioactive material or devices in violation of this Act. Prohibits any person, without lawful authority, from intentionally carrying, sending, or moving nuclear material into or out of a country. </p> <p>Includes acts of nuclear terrorism prohibited by this Act: (1) within the definition of &quot;federal crime of terrorism,&quot; and (2) as a predicate in prosecutions for providing material support and resources to terrorists.</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Nuclear Terrorism Conventions Implementation and Safety of Maritime Navigation Act of 2015</b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify the penalty for certain offenses involving: (1) violence against maritime navigation and maritime transport involving weapons of mass destruction, and (2) violence against a fixed maritime platform. Specifically, it broadens the existing penalty for a defendant who commits such an offense that results in a person's death&#8212;currently, a prison term of any years or for life&#8212;to permit a death penalty sentence.</p> <p>(Sec. 3) The bill modifies criminal penalties for a defendant who knowingly commits, or threatens, attempts, or conspires to commit, an act of nuclear terrorism with the intent to cause death, serious injury, or damage. Specifically, it revises existing penalties&#8212;currently, a fine of up to $2 million and a prison term of any years or for life&#8212;to subject a violator to a prison term of any years or for life, and if death results, a death penalty sentence or a prison term of any years or for life.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) The bill expands the predicate offenses that constitute the crime of providing material support to terrorists to include: (1) violence against maritime navigation and maritime transport involving weapons of mass destruction, (2) violence against a fixed maritime platform, and (3) nuclear terrorism.</p> <p>(Sec. 5) It expands the Department of Justice's authority to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications to include investigations of offenses related to: (1) violence against maritime navigation and maritime transport involving weapons of mass destruction, (2) violence against a fixed maritime platform, and (3) nuclear terrorism.</p> <p>(Sec. 6) The bill expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States must not bar individuals from entering the United States based on their religion, and (2) the individual right to bear arms is a fundamental right necessary to our system of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in U.S. history and tradition. </p>]]></text>
