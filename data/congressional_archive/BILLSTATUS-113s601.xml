Requires such amounts to be used only for harbor maintenance programs.</p> <p>Provides that such minimum resource requirement shall not apply if it would result in making lower amounts available for the applicable fiscal year to carry out all programs, projects, and activities of the civil works program of the Corps, other than the harbor maintenance programs, than were made available for those purposes in the previous fiscal year, with specified exceptions. Excludes any amounts that are designated for emergency requirements and disaster relief from amounts made available to carry out all programs, projects, and activities of the civil works program of the Corps.</p> <p> (Sec. 8004) Declares it is the policy of the United States that the primary use of such Fund is for maintaining the constructed widths and depths of the commercial ports and harbors of the United States and those functions should be given first consideration in the budgeting of Fund allocations.</p> <p>Requires the Chief of Engineers, in allocating amounts that are made available from such Fund for operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of all harbors and that are in excess of the amounts made available to carry out such projects in FY2012, to give priority to projects in the following order: (1) those projects that are high-use deep draft and are a priority for navigation in the Great Lakes Navigation System but that are not maintained to their constructed width and depth, (2) moderate-use and low-use port projects that have been maintained at less than their constructed width and depth, and (3) other projects that are not maintained to the minimum width and depth necessary to provide sufficient clearance for fully loaded commercial vessels.
