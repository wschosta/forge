and (3) within five years, to expand such system to all land, air, and sea ports of entry. </p> <p>Prohibits travel, training, bonuses, or salary increases for DHS political appointees if the metrics requirements, the objectives relating to the achievement of situational awareness and operational control, or the biometric exit data system requirements are not met.</p> <p>Directs DHS to submit a northern border threat analysis.</p> <p>Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in DHS a program known as Operation Stonegarden, under which DHS shall make grants to eligible law enforcement agencies to enhance border security.</p> <p>Authorizes the sale or donation of certain excess personal property of DOD for border security activities.</p> <p>Directs DOD to reimburse states for the cost of the deployment of any National Guard units or personnel to perform operations and missions under State Active Duty status in support of a southern border mission, subject to a specified cap.</p> <p>Directs DHS to hire, train, and assign to duty, by September 30, 2019: (1) 5,000 full-time CBP officers to serve on all inspection lanes and enforcement teams at U.S. land ports of entry on the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico;

(2) a report on a plan for each of DHS, USDA, and the Department of Health and Human Services for ensuring the placement of sufficient CBP agriculture specialists, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service entomologist identifier specialists, Food and Drug Administration consumer safety officers, and other relevant and related personnel at all land ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border; and (3) an annual report that details the implementation plan for required staff enhancements. </p> <p>Directs DHS to ensure that each CBP officer is equipped with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows CBP officers to communicate between ports of entry and inspection stations and with law enforcement entities.</p> <p>Requires DHS to establish a program for awarding grants for the purchase of: (1) identification and detection equipment; and (2) mobile, hand-held, two-way communication devices for law enforcement officers serving on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p> <p>Authorizes CBP to aid in the enforcement of federal customs, immigration, and agriculture laws by: (1) designing, constructing, and modifying U.S. ports of entry, living quarters for personnel, technology and equipment, and other structures and facilities; (2) acquiring land necessary to carry out CBP's duties; (3) implementing a biometric exit data system; and (4) constructing additional ports of entry along the U.S.borders with Mexico and Canada.</p> <p>Directs CBP, in coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA), to give priority consideration to projects that will substantially:</p> <ul> <li>reduce commercial and passenger vehicle and pedestrian crossing wait times at ports of entry; </li> <li>increase trade, travel efficiency, and the projected total annual volume at ports of entry; </li> <li>enhance safety and security at border facilities; </li> <li>reduce the flow of cross-border threats; and </li> <li>substantially reduce passenger vehicle and pedestrian crossing wait times by upgrading or expanding existing ports of entry. </li></ul> <p>Requires DHS to consult with Interior, USDA, the Secretary of State, the International Boundary and Water Commission, the International Joint Commission, and appropriate representatives of states, Indian tribes, local governments, and property owners to: (1) determine locations for new ports of entry; and (2) minimize adverse impacts from such ports on the environment, historic and cultural resources, commerce, and the quality of life of the communities and residents located near such ports.</p> <p>Permits DHS, upon determining that the acquisition of a leasehold interest in real property and the construction or modification of any facility on the leased property is necessary to facilitate the implementation of this Act, to acquire such interest and construct or modify such facility. </p> <p>Allows CBP and GSA, over a 10-year period, to: (1) enter into cost-sharing or reimbursement agreements or accept donations of real or personal property to facilitate the construction, alteration, operation, or maintenance of a facility or other infrastructure at a port of entry;
