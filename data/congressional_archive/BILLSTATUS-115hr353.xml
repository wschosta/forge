Congress urges that at least 30% of the funds authorized for research and development be made available for this purpose.</p> <p>(Sec.103)NOAA must establish a tornado warning improvement and extension program to reduce the loss of life and economic losses from tornadoes through the development and extension of accurate, effective, and timely tornado forecasts, predictions, and warnings, including the prediction of tornadoes beyond one hour in advance.</p> <p>(Sec.104)In collaboration with the U.S. weather industry and appropriate academic entities, and through the National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA must plan and maintain a project to improve hurricane forecasting, including:</p> <ul> <li>the prediction of rapid intensification and track of hurricanes,</li> <li>the forecast and communication of storm surges from hurricanes, and</li> <li>risk communication research to create more effective watch and warning products. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec.105)The OAR must issue a research and development and research to operations plan to restore and maintain U.S. leadership in numerical weather prediction (processing weather data with computer models) and forecasting. </p> <p>(Sec.106)NOAA must: (1) prioritize observation data requirements necessary to ensure weather forecasting capabilities to protect life and property to the maximum extent practicable; (2) evaluate observing systems, data, and information needed to meet those requirements; (3) identify data gaps in observing capabilities; and (4) determine a range of options to address those gaps.</p> <p>(Sec.107)The OAR must undertake Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) to assess the value and benefits of observing capabilities and systems. </p> <p>OSSEs must be conducted before: (1) acquisition of major government-owned or government-leased operational observing systems with a lifecycle cost of more than $500 million, and (2) purchase of any major new commercially provided data with a lifecycle cost of more than $500 million. </p> <p> The OAR must complete an OSSE to assess the value of data from Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation and from a geostationary hyperspectral sounder global constellation.</p> <p>(Sec.108)The bill requires an annual report on NOAA computing priorities and upgrades as these relate to weather prediction.</p> <p>(Sec.109)The U.S. Weather Research Program must: (1) report annually to Congress about on-going research projects and the five NOAA projects related to observations, weather, or subseasonal forecasts closest to operationalization; (2) establish teams with staff from the OAR and the NWS to oversee the operationalization of research projects; (3)develop mechanisms for research priorities; (4)develop a system to track research goals; (5)provide testing facilities; and (6) facilitate visiting scholars.</p> <p>(Sec.110)The bill authorizes through FY2018: (1) the OAR's weather laboratories and cooperative institutes and weather and air chemistry research programs, and (2) a joint technology transfer initiative. </p> <p>TITLE II--SUBSEASONAL AND SEASONAL FORECASTING INNOVATION</p> <p>(Sec.201)The NWSmust collect and utilize information to make reliable and timely foundational forecasts of subseasonal and seasonal temperature and precipitation. Subseasonal forecasting is forecasting weather between two weeks and three months and seasonal forecasting is between three months and two years.</p> <p>TITLE III--WEATHER SATELLITE AND DATA INNOVATION</p> <p>(Sec.301)NOAA must complete and operationalize the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (a weather satellite program which develops observational techniques using global navigation systems).</p> <p>(Sec.302)The bill permits the purchase of weather data by the federal government through contracts with commercial providers and the placement of weather satellite instruments on co-hosted government or private payloads.</p> <p>(Sec.303)NOAA must avoid unnecessary duplication between public and private sources of data and the corresponding expenditure of funds and employment of personnel.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEDERAL WEATHER COORDINATION</p> <p>(Sec.401)The NOAA Science Advisory Board must continue to maintain the Environmental Information Services Working Group. Membership requirements and reporting requirements for the group are established. </p> <p>(Sec.402)The Office of Science and Technology Policy must establish an Inter-agency Committee for Advancing Weather Services to improve coordination of relevant weather research and forecast innovation activities. </p> <p>(Sec.403)The OAR and the NWS may establish a program to detail their personnel to each other with the goal of enhancing forecasting innovation through regular, direct interaction between OAR scientists and NWS operational staff.</p> <p>(Sec.404)The NWS may establish a program to host postdoctoral fellows and academic researchers at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. </p> <p>(Sec.405)The NWS must designate warning coordination meteorologists at each of its weather forecast offices.</p> <p>(Sec.406)NOAA must conduct an evaluation of its system for issuing watches and warning regarding hazardous weather and water events.</p> <p>(Sec.407)The NWS may establish the NOAA Weather Ready All Hazards Award Program.The program must provide annual awards to individuals or organizations that use NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards receivers or transmitters to save lives and protect property.</p> <p>(Sec.408)NOAA must analyze the impacts of the proposed Air Force divestiture in the U.S. Weather Research and Forecasting Model, including the impact on: </p> <ul> <li>U.S. weather forecasting capabilities,</li> <li>the accuracy of civilian regional forecasts,</li> <li>the civilian readiness for traditional and extreme weather events in the United States, and</li> <li>the research necessary to develop the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec.409)NOAA must contract or continue to partner with an external organization to conduct a baseline analysis of the NWS operations and workforce. </p> <p>(Sec.410)NOAA must submit a report to Congress on the use of contract employees at the NWS.</p> <p>(Sec.411)The NWS must review existing research, products, and services that meet the specific needs of the urban environment, including those with the potential for improving modeling and forecasting capabilities by taking into account factors such as varying building heights, impermeable surfaces, lack of tree canopy, traffic pollution, and inter-building wind effects.</p> <p>(Sec.412)NOAA may establish mechanisms for outreach to:(1)assess the weather forecasts and forecast products provided by NOAA, and (2)determine the highest priority weather forecast needs of specific communities.</p>]]></text>
