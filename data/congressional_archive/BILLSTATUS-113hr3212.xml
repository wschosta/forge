</li> <li>initially respond by communicating with the country's Central Authority, and if unsuccessful, target subsequent actions as narrowly as practicable and in ways that respect the country's separation of powers and judicial independence; and </li> <li>seek to minimize any adverse impact on the population of the targeted country, the humanitarian activities of the United States and nongovernmental organizations, and U.S. national security interests. </ul> <p>(Sec. 202) States that it is U.S. policy to: </p> <ul> <li> oppose institutional or other systemic failures of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the Convention or bilateral procedures to resolve abduction and access cases;</li> <li>promote reciprocity pursuant to the Convention or bilateral procedures; and </li> <li> engage with senior foreign government officials to address patterns of noncompliance.</li> </ul> <p>Directs the Secretary to: (1) review the status of abduction and access cases in each foreign country to determine whether the government has engaged in a pattern of noncompliance during the preceding 12 months, and (2) determine the responsible government agencies or instrumentalities.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary, with respect to a country with a pattern of noncompliance, to:</p> <ul> <li>take actions specified under this Act, </li> <li>direct the Chief of Mission in the country to address such systemic problems, and </li> <li>inform senior government officials of the potential repercussions related to the noncompliant designation. </ul> <p>Declares that the Secretary shall not be required to take such actions for up to 90 days if the Secretary certifies to Congress that the additional period is necessary: (1) to continue negotiations with, or review corrective action taken by, the country; or (2) because the country will take corrective action within such 90-day period.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the specific actions taken against countries determined to have been engaged in a pattern of noncompliance.</p> <p>Sets forth the following actions to be taken in instances of patterns of noncompliance: </p> <ul> <li>a demarche (a diplomatic request or intercession with a foreign official or a protest about a government's policy or actions); </li> <li>an official public statement detailing unresolved cases; </li> <li>a public condemnation; </li> <li>a delay or cancellation of one or more bilateral working, official, or state visits; </li> <li>the withdrawal, limitation, or suspension of U.S. development or security assistance, or assistance to a central government; </li> <li>a formal request to a foreign country to extradite an individual who is engaged in abduction and who has been formally accused of, charged with, or convicted of an extraditable offense; or </li> <li>other commensurate actions.</li> </ul> <p>States that any such action may not prohibit or restrict the provision of humanitarian assistance. </p> <p>(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to request consultations with the government of a country regarding the situation giving rise to a determination under section 201 or an action under section 202 of this Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 204) Authorizes the Secretary to waive any section 202 actions if the Secretary certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of such country has resolved the relevant abduction cases, or has ended the pattern of noncompliance; or (2) U.S. national security interests require the waiver. </p> <p>(Sec. 205) States that any action taken under this Act with respect to a foreign country shall terminate on the date on which the Secretary certifies to Congress that the country's government: (1) has resolved any relevant abduction case, or (2) has taken verifiable steps to correct the pattern of noncompliance that gave rise to such action. </p> <p><b>Title III: Prevention of International Child Abduction</b> - (Sec. 301) Amends the the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to establish a program that: (1) prevents a child from leaving U.S. territory if the child's parent or legal guardian presents a court order to a CBP officer in time to prevent such departure, and (2) leverages other existing authorities to address the wrongful removal and return of a child.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to convene and chair an interagency working group to prevent international parental child abduction.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide training on the handling of parental abduction cases to the judicial and administrative authorities in countries that have a significant number of unresolved abduction cases or that have been designated as having a pattern of noncompliance, and (2) submit a strategy to Congress for carrying out such activities. </p> <p>Authorizes FY2015-FY2016 appropriations.</p>]]></text>
