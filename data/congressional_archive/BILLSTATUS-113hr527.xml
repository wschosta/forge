          <text><![CDATA[<p>Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Helium Act to define the &quot;Federal Helium Reserve&quot; as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Cliffside Gas Field and supporting infrastructure, including: (1) the Cliffside Gas Field helium storage reservoir; and (2) all associated infrastructure owned, leased, or managed under contract by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) for helium storage, transportation, withdrawal, purification, or management.</p> <p>Defines &quot;qualifying domestic helium transaction&quot; as any new or newly negotiated agreement for the purchase or sale of at least 15 million standard cubic feet of crude helium or bulk liquid helium delivered in the United States in the most recent full fiscal year, excluding the purchase of crude helium from the Secretary.</p> <p>(Sec. 3) Revises requirements for the sale of helium by dividing sales into three phases: (1) Phase A: Finalizing Debt Payoff, (2) Phase B: Maximizing Total Recovery of Helium and Increasing Returns to the American Taxpayer, and (3) Phase C: Access for Federal Users.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary (who currently is merely authorized) to offer for sale crude helium for federal, medical, research, scientific, and commercial uses (stated uses) in such quantities, at such times, and under such conditions (stated conditions) as necessary to carry out Phase A with minimum market disruption. Requires the Secretary, during Phase A, to offer for sale during each fiscal year a quantity of crude helium equivalent to the quantity of crude helium produced from the Federal Helium Reserve during FY2012. </p> <p>Authorizes agencies and holders of federal research grants to purchase refined helium during Phase A from persons who have entered into enforceable contracts to purchase an equivalent quantity of crude helium from the Secretary.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to establish prices for crude helium sales during Phase A that are not less than the price in the last sale of crude helium from the Reserve before enactment of this Act, except that any sale to agencies or grant holders for an authorized purchase shall be at a price specified by the Secretary. </p> <p>Terminates Phase A one year after this Act's enactment.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary, during Phase B, to offer for sale at auction crude helium for the stated uses and under the stated conditions as necessary to: (1) maximize total recovery and conservation of helium from the Reserve; (2) manage crude helium sales according to the Secretary's ability to extract and produce helium from the Reserve; (3) respond to helium market supply and demand and minimize market disruption; and (4) give priority to meeting the helium demand of federal users through certain in-kind purchases by federal agencies and grantees.</p> <p>Authorizes federal agencies and holders of federal research grants, during Phase B, to purchase refined helium for federal, medical, research, and scientific uses from a helium distributer registered with the Secretary.
