          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tax Refund Protection Act of 201</strong><b>7</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to direct the Department of the Treasury to establish a program to license or certify and regulate tax return preparers. The program must require tax return preparers to: (1) demonstrate good character, good reputation, necessary qualifications, and competency; (2) pay a reasonable fee for licensing or certification; and (3) make certain disclosures regarding fees charged and the average amount of time expected to receive a tax refund. </p> <p>Treasury may take enforcement actions against a tax return preparer who is incompetent, disreputable, violates regulations, or misleads or threatens a consumer.</p> <p>The bill also amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)&nbsp;to regulate refund anticipation payment arrangements. A refund anticipation payment arrangement is an arrangement under which, in exchange for tax preparation services, a taxpayer agrees to pay a fee or interest upon receipt of a tax refund to a preparer or lender either by: (1) requesting the federal government to deposit a tax refund, or a portion of the refund, into an account; or (2) directly paying the preparer or lender. </p> <p>The CFPB shall require tax return preparers offering a refund anticipation payment arrangement to provide a disclosure statement to a consumer about the arrangement and shall promulgate regulations that require preparers to comply with the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act. </p> <p>Finally, the bill allows an income tax refund requested on a tax return prepared by an income tax preparer to be split between the preparer and the taxpayer and prohibits the treatment of such a split as disreputable conduct merely because the taxpayer requested such split.</p>]]></text>
