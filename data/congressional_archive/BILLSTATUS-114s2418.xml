          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Countering Online Recruitment of Violent Extremists Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that the criteria for the designation of colleges or universities as a center for homeland security include demonstrated expertise in countering violent extremism (CVE).

A &quot;technology-based CVE solution&quot; is defined as an instrument developed by a participating student that:</p> <ul> <li>appeals to young consumers of online and social media;</li> <li>counters online recruitment of violent extremists or builds resilience against online violent extremist recruitment among participating students' peers;</li> <li>operates on a technological platform or is technological in nature, including social media campaigns and mobile software applications; and</li> <li>is supported by empirical evidence and incorporates metrics for future assessment.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 5) An institution of higher education at which a CVE lab is established shall ensure that the lab's faculty:</p> <ul> <li> creates a curriculum for participating students to develop and test CVE solutions, that shall include a CVE orientation program during which federal officials shall brief students on precautions to protect themselves from becoming a target of terrorists;</li> <li> supervises any deployment of a technology-based CVE solution by a student;</li> <li>develops a framework for participation and support of other programs that encourages peer-to-peer CVE solutions;</li> <li>develops a common inventory of research, in conjunction with other centers that establish CVE labs, on core CVE issues to inform CVE lab curricula; and</li> <li>identifies experts who can apply CVE solutions to target susceptible individuals.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 6) The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on, and DHS to commission an independent third-party assessment of, the impact of each lab. </p> <p>(Sec. 8) The bill sunsets seven years after enactment.</p>]]></text>
