The due date for the annual information return of a foreign trust with a U.S. owner and for the report of foreign bank and financial accounts is April 15 (with extensions until October 15).</p> <p>The automatic extension for corporation income tax returns is&nbsp; increased from three months to&nbsp;six months. </p> <p>TITLE III--PROVISIONS RELATED TO START-UP BUSINESSES </p> <p>(Sec. 301) The required holding period for qualified small business stock is reduced from 5 years to 3 years for purposes of determining capital gains tax treatment of such stock. The period for rolling over gain from the sale of such stock without tax consequences is extended from 60 days to 1 year. </p> <p>TITLE IV--PROMOTION AND EXPANSION OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP</p> <p><em>Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2015</em></p> <p>(Sec. 403) This section extends to all domestic corporations, including S corporations, provisions allowing deferral of tax on the gain from the sale of employer securities to an S corporation-sponsored employer stock ownership plan (ESOP).</p> <p>(Sec. 404) This section directs Treasury to establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S corporations. The Office shall provide: (1) education and outreach to inform companies and individuals about the possibilities and benefits of employee ownership of S corporations, and (2) technical assistance to assist S corporations in sponsoring employee stock ownership plans </p> <p>(Sec. 405) This section amends the Small Business Act to define &quot;ESOP business concern" and allow such a concern to continue to qualify for loans, preferences, and other programs under such Act. </p>]]></text>
