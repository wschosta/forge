          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Honoring Hometown Heroes Act </b></p> <p>This bill authorizes the governor of a state, territory, or possession of the United States or the Mayor of the District of Columbia to proclaim that the U.S. flag shall be flown at half-staff in the event of the death of a first responder (public safety officer) working in such jurisdiction who dies while serving in the line of duty. </p> <p>DIVISION B--FURTHER EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 </p> <p><i>Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 </i></p> <p>This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to most federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law). </p> <p>It prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing continuing resolution expires because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted. </p> <p>The division also: (1) authorizes the Department of Energy to drawdown and sell specified crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in FY2018; and (2) makes additional funding available for the 2020 Decennial Census Program, the Southeastern Power Administration, and juror fees. </p> <p>The division provides emergency funding for the Small Business Administration Disaster Loans Program Account. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.) </p> <p>DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 </p> <p>This division provides appropriations to the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2018. </p> <p>DIVISION D--MISCELLANEOUS </p> <p>This division amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the Department of Agriculture Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) through FY2019. (EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for agricultural producers and land owners to implement certain conservation practices.) </p> <p>DIVISION E--TAX MATTERS </p> <p>This division amends the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 to repeal the 8% increase in the amount of the required installment of corporate estimated tax otherwise due in July, August, or September of 2020. It also increases the next required installment to reflect the amount of the decrease due to this division. </p> <p>DIVISION F--HEALTH PROVISIONS </p> <p><i>Strengthening and Underpinning the Safety-net to Aid Individuals Needing Care Act of 2018 or the SUSTAIN Care Act of 2018</i></p> <p>This division extends and otherwise revises various Medicare programs and payment rules, including: </p> <ul> <li> the Medicare-dependent hospital program; </li> <li> the Independence at Home Demonstration Program; </li> <li> certain outreach and counseling programs; and </li> <li> specified payment rules related to certain low-volume hospitals, home health-care services, and misvalued services. </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the division modifies Medicare provisions related to supervision requirements, home-health claims, intensive cardiac-rehabilitation programs, telehealth, accountable care organizations, medical records, accreditation, physician self-referral, speech-generating devices, fraud and abuse, coverage of certain testing services, hospital transfers to hospice, ambulance transports, certain outpatient therapy services, long-term care hospital payments, and biosimilar products. </p> <p>With respect to Medicare Advantage, the division: </p> <ul> <li> reauthorizes and otherwise revises special-needs plans; </li> <li> expands testing of the Value-Based Insurance Design Model; and </li> <li> modifies provisions related to supplemental benefits, telehealth, and quality ratings. </li> </ul> <p>With respect to Medicaid, the bill modifies provisions related to third-party liability, lump-sum income, and disproportionate-share hospital payments. </p> <p>The division reduces annual funding available to the Medicare Improvement Fund and the Medicaid Improvement Fund and modifies the amount of annual funding available to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. </p> <p>The division also extends specified public health programs. </p> <p>In addition, the division establishes or revises various reporting requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, certain suppliers of ground ambulance services, and the Government Accountability Office. </p> <p><i>Family First Prevention Services Act </i></p> <p>The division modifies various provisions related to foster care and adoption. Specifically, the division: </p> <ul> <li> revises funding and eligibility requirements with respect to foster-care prevention services and programs;</li> <li>limits federal funding for placements that are not in foster-family homes; </li> <li> provides for grants to support the recruitment and retention of high-quality foster families; </li> <li> provides for social-impact partnerships; </li> <li> extends and otherwise revises various other programs; and </li> <li> modifies provisions related to foster-care maintenance payments, evidence-based kinship navigator programs, family-reunification services, interstate case processing, regional-partnership grants, qualified residential-treatment programs, records checks, adoption assistance, child-support enforcement, and prison-data reporting. </li> </ul> <p>DIVISION G--BUDGETARY EFFECTS </p> <p>This division exempts the budgetary effects of division D and each succeeding division of this bill from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines. </p>]]></text>

The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made. </p> <p>It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare. </p> <p>(Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.) </p> <p>(Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero. </p> <p>(Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill.

It also recognizes that each chamber has the authority to change the rules. </p> <p>TITLE II--OFFSETS </p> <p>(Sec. 30201) This section amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the authority of Treasury to collect certain customs user fees. </p> <p>It also amends the United States--Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act to extend the increased rate for merchandise processing fees. </p> <p>(Sec. 30202) This section extends the requirement for DOT to deposit into the Treasury a portion of the aviation security service fees charged to passengers of air carriers. </p> <p>(Sec. 30203) This section amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to extend certain immigration fees for: (1) using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program, and (2) L-1 (intracompany transferees) and H-1B visas (temporary workers in professions specialty occupations). </p> <p>(Sec. 30204) DOE must draw down and sell specified oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2022-FY2025, FY2026, and FY2027 and deposit the proceeds in the Treasury during the fiscal year in which the sale occurs. </p> <p>DOE may not draw down and sell crude oil under this section in quantities that would limit the authority to sell petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in order to prevent or reduce adverse impacts of severe domestic energy supply interruptions. </p> <p>This section amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to: (1) modify the conditions for a drawdown for the SPR to require DOE to find that the action will not impair the ability of the U.S. to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy program, and (2) prohibit a draw down when there are fewer than 450 million (currently 350 million) barrels of petroleum product stored in the SPR. </p> <p>(Sec. 30205) This section amends the Federal Reserve Act to reduce the limit on the aggregate amount of the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks from $10 million to $7.5 million. Under current law, surplus funds that exceed or would exceed the limit must be deposited into the Treasury. </p> <p>(Sec. 30206) The Department of Labor must award grants for states to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for certain individuals who receive unemployment compensation. </p> <p>This section also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require discretionary spending limits, committee allocations, and budget aggregates to be adjusted, subject to specified limits, for legislation that appropriates more than $117 million for a fiscal year for the grants. </p> <p>TITLE III--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT </p> <p>(Sec. 30301) The public debt limit is suspended through March 1, 2019.
