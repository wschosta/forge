Establishes a point of order against legislation (other than appropriations measures) with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods. </p> <p>(Sec. 302) Provides the House Appropriations Committee with a separate allocation for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing and adjusting the allocation. <p>(Sec. 303) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation for FY2017-FY2019. Limits CHIMPs that reduce budget authority in the budget year but do not decrease outlays over the period of the total of the current year, budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently agreed to budget resolution. Limit the CHIMPS to: $19.1 billion for FY2017, $17 billion for FY2018, and $15 billion for FY2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) Requires the Government Accountability Office to submit to the chair of the House Budget Committee a comprehensive list of all current direct spending programs. Requires the chair to publish the list in the Congressional Record and on the committee's website.</p> <p>(Sec. 305) Permits the chair of the House Budget Committee to direct the CBO to include changes in debt service costs in estimates of legislation except for authorizations of discretionary programs or appropriation measures. </p> <p>Specifies that: (1) this section applies to changes in the authorization level of appropriated entitlements, and (2) the estimates are advisory and may not be used for budget enforcement. </p> <p>(Sec. 306) Requires the CBO, upon request of the chairman of the House Budget Committee, to include supplemental fair-value estimates in estimates for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program. </p> <p>Requires the CBO to provide a supplemental fair-value estimate for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program for student financial assistance or housing (including residential mortgage).</p> <p>Requires the CBO to include estimates, on a fair-value and credit reform basis, of loan and loan guarantee programs for student financial assistance, housing (including residential mortgage), and other major loan and loan guarantee programs in its &quot;Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2027.&quot; </p> <p>(A fair-value estimate is an alternative to federal credit program estimates required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [FCRA]. Under FCRA, cash flows are discounted using Treasury interest rates for estimating subsidy costs. The fair-value method incorporates market risk by using market rates.)</p> <p>(Sec. 307) Requires the CBO to estimate outlay changes during the second and third decades of enactment for any direct spending legislative provision if: </p> <ul> <li> it proposes changes that will have an outlay impact exceeding 0.25% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States during the first decade or in the 10th year, or </li> <li>the chairman of the House Budget Committee requests the estimate. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 308) Requires the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate macroeconomic effects in estimates of specified legislation (commonly referred to as dynamic scoring). </p> <p>(Sec. 309) Authorizes the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations and levels in this resolution if legislation decreases direct spending in any fiscal year and authorizes appropriations for the same purpose. </p> <p>(Sec. 310) Prohibits advanced appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advanced appropriations do not exceed specified limits.

Specifies that the contracts are to be scored as direct spending and that savings resulting from the contracts may be not be used as an offset for budget enforcement purposes. </p> <p>(Under an energy savings performance contract, a private party agrees to fund energy-efficient upgrades for a federal facility, and the federal agency agrees to pay the private party from reductions in the agency's energy costs. Under a utility energy service contract, the services and equipment are provided by a utility.)</p> <p>(Sec. 312) Requires the CBO to include specified details in its estimates for legislation conveying federal land to a non-federal entity. </p> <p>(Sec. 313) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs. </p> <p>(Sec. 314) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used for budget enforcement purposes. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 315) Prohibits transfers of surpluses of the Federal Reserve System from being counted as offsets for budget enforcement purposes. (This section prevents the transfers from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>Subtitle B--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 321) Specifies that the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Committee retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. </p> <p>Requires the administrative expenses to be included in the cost estimates used to determine if an appropriations bill exceeds the spending limits in this resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 322) Sets forth procedures for the adjustment of allocations, aggregates, and other levels included in this resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 323) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this resolution for any change in budgetary concepts and definitions pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. </p> <p>(Sec. 324) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this resolution for any changes that the CBO makes to its baseline in March 2016. </p> <p>(Sec. 325) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this resolution for any legislation that designates an emergency under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO). </p> <p>(Sec. 326) Affirms that the adoption of this budget resolution is an exercise of the House's rulemaking power and that the House has the constitutional right to change these rules. </p> <p>TITLE IV--RESERVE FUNDS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p> <p>Establishes reserve funds that permit the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust the levels and allocations included in the budget resolution to accommodate health, tax reform, trade, education, retirement, and transportation legislation that meets specified conditions. </p> <p>(Reserve funds provide the House Budget Committee Chairman with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to legislation that meets specified criteria.)</p> <p>(Sec. 401) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that reduces poverty and increases opportunity and upward mobility, without adversely impacting job creation or increasing the deficit over the period of FY2017-FY2026. </p> <p>(Sec. 402) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that repeals or modifies the Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. </p> <p>(Sec. 403) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for health care reform legislation that would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2026 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 404) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that reforms, expands access to, and improves graduate medical education programs and would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2026 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 405) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that implements a trade agreement and would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2026 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 406) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that reforms the tax code and would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2026 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 407) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that decreases revenue and would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2026 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 408) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that reforms, improves, and updates the federal retirement system and would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2017-FY2026. </p> <p>(Sec. 409) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that addresses the immediate funding shortfall in coal miner pension and health care funds and would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2017-FY2026. </p> <p>(Sec. 410) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that commercializes the air traffic control system and reduces discretionary spending limits by the amount that was appropriated to the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control. </p> <p>TITLE V--ESTIMATES OF DIRECT SPENDING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p> <p>(Sec. 501) Provides estimates for the rate of growth in means-tested and non-means-tested direct spending and proposes changes to Medicaid and Medicare. </p> <p>TITLE VI--POLICY STATEMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p> <p>(Sec. 601) States the policy of this resolution that committees in the House should consider in the 115th Congress recommendations developed by the Speaker's task forces on health care reform;
