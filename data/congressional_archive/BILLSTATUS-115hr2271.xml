          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Flexibility for Working Families Act</b></p> <p>This bill allows an employee to request from an employer a temporary or permanent change in the terms or conditions of the employee's employment if the request relates to: (1) the number of hours the employee is required to work, (2) the times when the employee is required to work or be on call for work, (3) where the employee is required to work, or (4) the amount of notification the employee receives of work schedule assignments. The bill sets forth certain employer duties with respect to such requests.</p> <p>The bill prohibits an employer from interfering with any rights provided to an employee under this bill. An employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor for any violations of such rights. Labor shall investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints and may issue orders making determinations and assessing civil penalties or awarding relief for alleged violations. The bill provides for judicial review of such orders, including in federal courts of appeal.</p> <p> Labor and certain federal agencies and offices shall provide information and technical assistance to employers, labor organizations, and the general public regarding compliance with this bill. </p> <p> The Wage and Hour Division of Labor must issue guidance on compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act that provides for a flexible work environment through changes in employee terms and conditions of employment as provided in this bill. </p> <p>The requirements of this bill are applicable to certain classes of employees, including employees of the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress. </p>]]></text>
