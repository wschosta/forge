          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Official Personnel File Enhancement Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires that a permanent notation be made in the official personnel record file of a federal employee in the competitive or excepted service who is the subject of a personnel investigation for misconduct or poor performance and who resigns prior to the resolution of such investigation, if an adverse finding is made against such employee at the close of such investigation. The head of the agency employing such employee must make reasonable efforts to notify the employee of the permanent notation.</p> <p>The bill also requires any federal government appointing authority to review and consider the personnel file of a former federal employee who is a candidate for a position within the competitive or excepted service prior to appointing or reinstating such employee to such a position. </p>]]></text>
