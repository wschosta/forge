This amendment shall state that an investment adviser to a private fund is not required to report any information beyond that which is required by sections 1a and 1b of Form PF unless it is a large hedge fund adviser or a large liquidity fund adviser.</p> <p>The SEC shall also amend the regulation requiring that client funds and securities of which an investment adviser has custody are verified by actual examination periodically by an independent public accountant. The current &quot;privately offered securities&quot; exemptions from this custody rule must apply to both certificated and uncertificated securities and exempt special purpose vehicles managed by private fund sponsors and co-investment funds that hold only one investment.</p> <p>The SEC shall amend the proxy voting regulation to waive its application to any voting authority exercised by an investment adviser regarding client securities that are not public securities.</p> <p>On the other hand, the SEC may not:</p> <ul> <li>amend a specified regulation to extend its requirements and prohibitions concerning investment company sales literature to offerings of securities issued by private funds, or</li> <li>adopt substantially similar rules applicable to such offerings.</li> </ul> <p>This bill shall not apply to advisory services supplied to an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</p>]]></text>

        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Torres motion to recommit with instructions pending a reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to add at the end of the bill a section pertaining to Report on Emergency Vehicle Response Times of Companies Owned by Private Funds. Subsequently, the reservation was removed.</text>

A bill summary describes the most significant provisions of a piece of legislation and details the effects the legislative text may have on current law and federal programs. Bill summaries are authored by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. As stated in Public Law 91-510 (2 USC 166 (d)(6)), one of the duties of CRS is "to prepare summaries and digests of bills and resolutions of a public general nature introduced in the Senate or House of Representatives".
