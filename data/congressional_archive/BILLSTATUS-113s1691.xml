          <text><![CDATA[<p>Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2013 - Sets forth additional&nbsp;requirements relating to the rates of pay and terms of employment&nbsp;for U.S. Border Patrol agents (i.e., federal employees who detect and prevent illegal entry and smuggling of aliens, commercial goods, narcotics, weapons, or contraband into the United States).</p> <p>Requires Border Patrol agents to elect each year to: (1) be assigned to either a specified&nbsp;level one or level two border patrol rate of pay governing regular rates of pay&nbsp;and overtime work requirements,&nbsp;or (2) decline to be assigned to either level.&nbsp;Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) should ensure that not more than 10% of agents stationed at a location decline to be assigned to either the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate of pay. Empowers CBP, without limitation, to require agents to perform overtime work in accordance with agency needs, including if needed in the event of a local or national emergency.</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2014 - States as the purposes of this Act: (1) strengthening U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ensuring that border patrol agents are sufficiently ready to conduct necessary work and will perform overtime hours in excess of a 40-hour workweek based on the needs of CBP, and (2) ensuring that CBP has the flexibility to cover shift changes and retains the right to assign scheduled and unscheduled work for mission requirements and planning based on operational need.</p> <p>Requires a border patrol agent, not later than 30 days before the first day of each year beginning after the enactment of this Act, to make an election whether such agent shall, for that year, be assigned to: (1) the level 1 border patrol rate of pay (i.e., hourly rate of pay equal to 1.25 times the otherwise applicable hourly rate of basic pay); (2) the level 2 border patrol rate of pay (i.e. the hourly rate of pay equal to 1.125 times the otherwise hourly rate of basic pay), or (3) the basic border patrol rate of pay, with additional overtime as needed by CBP. Requires: (1) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to promulgate regulations establishing procedures for such elections, and (2) CBP to provide each border patrol agent with information on each type of election available. Exempts from such limitation agents working at CBP headquarters or a CBP training location.</p> <p>Provides that an agent who fails to elect a pay level or an agent who is assigned a canine shall be assigned to the level 1 rate of pay. </p> <p>Requires CBP to: (1)&nbsp;assign an agent to the basic border patrol rate of pay until it determines that the agent is able to perform scheduled overtime on a daily basis, and (2) take such action to ensure that not more than 10% of the agents stationed at a location are assigned to the level 2 border patrol rate of pay or the basic border patrol rate of pay. Allows CBP to waive the 10% limitation if it determines that it may do so and adequately fulfill its operational requirements. </p> <p>Requires CBP to develop, implement, and report on&nbsp;a plan to ensure that the assignments of a border patrol agent, during the three years of service before such agent becomes eligible for immediate retirement, are consistent with the average border patrol rate of pay level to which the agent has been assigned during the course of his or her career. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the House Committees on Appropriations and Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committees on Appropriations and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (appropriate committees of Congress) on the effectiveness of the plan in ensuring that agents are not able to artificially enhance their retirement annuities. </p> <p>Specifies the terms and conditions of level 1 and 2 border patrol rates of pay, premium pay, eligibility for leave without pay, overtime, and compensatory time off. Requires CBP to avoid the use of scheduled overtime work by border patrol agents to the maximum extent practicable.</p> <p>Includes supplemental pay from levels 1 and 2 rates of pay as part of a border patrol agent's basic pay for purposes of calculating retirement annuities. </p> <p>Requires: (1)&nbsp;CBP to conduct and report to the Comptroller General on a comprehensive analysis that examines and estimates the costs of CBP's staffing requirements, and (2) the Comptroller General to submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the methodology used by CBP to carry out its analysis and on whether the Comptroller General concurs with report findings.&nbsp;</p> <p>States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) limit the right of CBP to assign both scheduled and unscheduled work to a border patrol agent based on the needs of the agency in excess of the hours of work normally applicable under the election made by the agent; (2) require compensation of an agent other than for hours during which the agent is actually performing work or using approved leave; or (3) exempt an agent from any limitations on pay, earnings, or compensation prescribed by law. </p> <p>Requires the OPM Director to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act. </p>]]></text>
