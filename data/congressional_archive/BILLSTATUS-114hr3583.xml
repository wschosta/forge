Each report must include a plan for continuation of the DHS program to provide vaccines to emergency response providers. </p> <p>(Sec. 302) The Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) responsibilities are expanded to include: </p> <ul> <li>establishing medical and human, animal, and occupational health exposure policies and initiatives; </li> <li>advising DHS and FEMA on the medical effects of terrorist attacks or other high consequence events utilizing chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents or explosives; </li> <li>coordinating DHS's preparedness for pandemics and emerging infectious diseases; </li> <li>serving as DHS's primary point of contact for emergency medical services and medical first responder stakeholders; </li> <li>ensuring that DHS's workforce has evidence-based standards for occupational health and operational medicine programs; and </li> <li>maintaining a coordinated system for medical support for DHS's operational activities. </li></ul> <p>The CMO must also: (1) review and maintain verification of the accreditation of DHS's health provider workforce; (2) develop quality assurances, clinical policies, and metrics for medical and health activities; (3) oversee medical records systems; and (4) provide medical direction for emergency medical services. </p> <p>The CMO may provide medical liaisons to DHS components to provide subject matter expertise on medical and public health issues and a direct link to the CMO. </p> <p>(Sec. 303) DHS must establish a medical countermeasures program to facilitate personnel readiness, and protection for working animals, employees, and individuals in DHS's care and custody, in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosives attack, naturally occurring disease outbreak, or pandemic. </p> <p>The CMO must: (1) oversee the program and maintain a medical countermeasures stockpile and dispensing system, (2) establish a medical countermeasures working group comprised of representatives from DHS offices to ensure that medical countermeasures standards are maintained and guidance is consistent, and (3) develop an integrated logistics support plan. </p> <p>TITLE IV--MANAGEMENT </p> <p>(Sec. 401) FEMA must designate a chief management official and principal advisor on FEMA management matters. </p> <p>The chief management official must be responsible for: (1) procurement; (2) human resources and personnel; (3) information technology and communications systems; (4) real property investment and planning, facilities, accountable personal property, records and disclosure, privacy, safety and health, and sustainability and environmental management; and (5) security for personnel, information technology and communications systems, facilities, property, equipment, and other material resources. </p> <p>The chief management official's responsibilities shall not be construed to affect the role of the Assistant Administrator for National Continuity as it relates to the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center and associated facilities. </p> <p>FEMA must submit to Congress: (1) a review of financial, human capital, information technology, real property planning, and acquisition management of its headquarters and regional offices; and (2) a strategy for capturing financial, human capital, information technology, real property planning, and acquisition data. </p> <p>(Sec. 402) FEMA must also report on its efforts to modernize its grants and financial information technology systems. </p> <p>(Sec. 403) Not later than May 1, 2016, and for each of the next five years, FEMA must update its strategic human capital plan. </p> <p>(Sec. 404) FEMA must integrate the needs of children into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such activities. </p> <p>TITLE V--FLOOD INSURANCE CLAIMS PROCESS REFORMS </p> <p>(Sec. 501) This title amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to direct FEMA to set forth requirements concerning the final engineering report of an engineer or any report of a claims adjustor for any on-site inspection of a property to assess a claim for losses covered by a flood insurance policy under such Act. Such a report: </p> <ul> <li>may not be transmitted to any other person, employer, agency, or entity, before it is transmitted to the insured; </li> <li>may not include alterations by, or at the request of, anyone other than the person responsible for the final engineering report or the preparer of the claims adjustor report, and shall include a certification that it does not contain any such alterations; and </li> <li>shall provide reasonable assurance that it was transmitted directly to the insured by such person or preparer. </li></ul> <p>For engineering reports, these requirements apply only to the final signed or sealed report that contains final conclusions. But for claims adjustor reports, the requirements apply to any document in connection with such claim that is based on the adjustor's on-site inspection, including any adjustment reports, field reports, drafts, preliminary versions, copies, amendments, or additions.</p> <p>If FEMA or an insurance company disallows a flood insurance claim, or if the claimant refuses to accept the allowed amount, the claimant may institute a court action against FEMA or the insurance company: (1) within two years after the occurrence of the losses involved in such claim; or (2) in the case of a denial of a claim that is appealed to FEMA, within 90 days after the final determination upon appeal denying such claim in whole or in part, or within two years after the loss, whichever is later. (These time periods replace current law that allows a claimant to institute such an action against FEMA or the insurance company within one year after the mailing of notice of disallowance or partial disallowance.)</p>]]></text>
