          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 </b></p> <p>This bill directs the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure that CBP partnership programs, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, provide trade benefits to importers, exporters, and certain other private sector entities that meet program requirements.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on the effectiveness of CBP enforcement of U.S. customs and trade laws (trade enforcement).</p> <p>CBP shall establish priorities and performance standards to measure levels of achievement of customs modernization, the movement of merchandise into and out of the United States (trade facilitation), and trade enforcement functions and programs.</p> <p>CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shall:</p> <ul> <li> establish educational seminars to improve CBP classification and appraisal of imported articles, trade enforcement, and facilitation of international trade; and </li> <li>develop biennially a joint strategic plan for improving trade enforcement and trade facilitation.</li> </ul> <p>This bill amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) to authorize appropriations for FY2016-FY2018 to complete the development and implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment computer system.</p> <p>This bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to work with the head of each agency participating in the International Trade Data System (ITDS) and the Interagency Steering Committee to ensure that, among other duties, it:</p> <ul> <li>develops and maintains the necessary information technology infrastructure to support the operation of the ITDS,</li> <li>submit all data to the ITDS electronically, and</li> <li>arrange to share information between each agency and the CBP. </li> </ul> <p>Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall jointly establish a Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee.</p> <p>CBP shall develop and implement CBP-wide Centers of Excellence and Expertise.</p> <p>DHS shall establish within the CBP Office of International Trade a Commercial Targeting Division (including National Targeting and Analysis Groups) to conduct commercial risk assessment targeting and, when needed, issue trade alerts with respect to cargo destined for the United States. </p> <p>The Treasury Inspector General shall report to Congress on oversight of revenue protection and enforcement measures. </p> <p>DHS and Treasury shall report jointly to Congress on security and revenue measures with respect to merchandise transported in bond. </p> <p>DHS shall establish a program to assign importer of record numbers. </p> <p>CBP shall establish a new importer program that adjusts bond amounts for new importers based on the level of risk assessed for revenue protection.</p> <p>The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe minimum standards to require customs brokers to implement, and importers (including nonresident importers) to comply with, reasonable procedures for collecting information to identify U.S. and non-resident importers seeking to import merchandise into the United States. </p> <p>The CBP Commissioner shall report to Congress recommendations for: </p> <ul> <li> determining the most effective way to require foreign nationals to provide customs brokers with accurate information, comparable to that required of U.S. nationals, on the identity of foreign nationals seeking to import merchandise into the United States;
