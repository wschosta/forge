Authorizes the Secretary to approve an alternative security program established by a private sector entity or a federal, state, or local authority that meets the requirements of this Act.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to:</p> <ul> <li>review and approve or disapprove each such assessment and plan using the risk assessment policies and procedures developed under this Act; </li> <li>conduct the audit and inspection of covered chemical facilities, including by using a non-government entity, to determine compliance with this Act; </li> <li>prescribe standards for the training and retraining of DHS or non-governmental auditors and inspectors; and </li> <li>provide written notification (including a clear explanation of any deficiency in the security vulnerability assessment or site security plan) to the owner or operator of a covered facility determined to not be in compliance with this Act; and </li> <li>issue to the owner or operator of such a facility an order to comply with this Act. </li></ul> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to issue an order assessing a civil penalty or requiring such a facility to cease operations if the owner or operator fails to comply. </p> <p>Defines: (1) a "covered chemical facility" to mean a chemical facility that the Secretary designates as a facility of interest and determines meets specified risk criteria, and (2) a "chemical facility of interest" to mean a facility that holds a chemical of interest at a threshold quantity that meets relevant risk-related criteria developed under this Act. Excepts certain chemical facilities, including Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) facilities.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to carry out a Personnel Surety Program that provides a participating facility owner or operator with feedback about individuals based on vetting against the terrorist screening database. Authorizes a covered chemical facility to use such a federal screening program in order to satisfy the requirements of a risk-based performance standard that address personnel surety. Requires the Secretary to direct DHS's Security Screening Coordination Office to coordinate with the National Protection and Programs Directorate to expedite the development of a common credential that screens against the terrorist screening database on a recurrent basis.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to: (1) consult with the heads of other federal agencies, states and political subdivisions, and relevant business associations to identify all chemical facilities of interest; and (2) develop a risk assessment approach and corresponding tiering methodology that incorporates all relevant elements of risk, including threat, vulnerability, and consequence.
