Redefines "anadromous fish" for purposes of such Act. Defines "reasonable flows" as water flows capable of being maintained taking into account competing consumptive uses of water and economic, environmental, and social factors.</p> <p>Eliminates existing limitations on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to enter into any new contracts for water supply from the CVP. Directs the Secretary to renew any existing long-term repayment or water service contract, upon request of the contractor, that provides for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 40 years (the current contractual term is 25 years). Requires new or renewed contracts to include a provision that requires the Secretary to charge only for water actually delivered.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to take all necessary actions to facilitate and expedite CVP water transfers in accordance with such Act or any other provision of federal reclamation law and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).</p> <p>Grants the Secretary discretion to modify CVP operations to provide reasonable water flows of suitable quality, quantity, and timing to protect all life stages of anadromous fish.</p> <p>Repeals a requirement that not less than 67% of all funds made available to the Restoration Fund under CVPIA be authorized to be appropriated to carry out habitat restoration, improvement, and acquisition provisions of that Act.</p> <p>Requires the CVP and the California State Water Project (SWP) to be operated pursuant to the water quality standards and operational constraints described in the "Principles for Agreement of the Bay-Delta Standards Between the State of California and the Federal Government," dated December 15, 1994 (Bay-Delta Accord of 1994), without regard to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) or any other law pertaining to the operation of the CVP and the SWP.</p> <p>Prohibits the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce from distinguishing between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned or otherwise artificially propagated strains of a species in making any determination under ESA that relates to any anadromous fish species that are present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers or their tributaries and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in the San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean.</p> <p>Adds the Kettleman City Community Services District as an authorized service area of the CVP. Directs the Secretary to enter into a long-term contract for the delivery of up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water for municipal and industrial use.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to offer to the Oakdale Irrigation District, the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, and the Calaveras County Water District a contract enabling such districts to collectively impound and store a portion of their Stanislaus River water rights in the New Melones Reservoir in accordance with applicable terms of the Warren Act. </p> <p>Establishes a pilot program to remove non-native predatory fish from the Stanislaus River. </p> <p>Directs the Secretary, if the San Luis Reservoir does not fill by the last day of February, to permit any entity with an agricultural water service or repayment contract for the delivery of water from the Delta Division or the San Luis Unit to reschedule into the immediately following contract year (i.e., March 1 through the last day of February) any unused CVP water previously allocated for irrigation purposes. </p> <p><strong>Title II: San Joaquin River Restoration</strong> - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease any action to implement the Stipulation of Settlement dated September 13, 2006, in the litigation entitled Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v.

Makes the Oakdale Irrigation District and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District responsible for the funding of such pilot program. Requires the Commissioner to post on the website of the Bureau of Reclamation a tabular summary of the raw data collected by the pilot program.</p> <p>(Sec. 115) Directs the Secretary, if the San Luis Reservoir does not fill by the last day of February, to permit any entity with an agricultural water service or repayment contract for the delivery of water from the Delta Division or the San Luis Unit to reschedule into the immediately following contract year (i.e., March 1 through the last day of February) any unused CVP water previously allocated for irrigation purposes. </p> <p><strong>Title II: San Joaquin River Restoration </strong>- (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease any action to implement the Stipulation of Settlement (Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California) (the Settlement). </p> <p>(Sec. 202) Modifies the purpose of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act to be restoration of the San Joaquin River (currently, to authorize implementation of the Settlement).</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Amends such Act to eliminate references to the Settlement and to direct the Secretary, beginning on March 1, 2015, to modify Friant Dam operations to release restoration flows (defined as additional water released or bypassed from Friant Dam to ensure that the target flow entering Mendota Pool does not fall below 50 cubic feet per second) in every year except a critical water year (defined as when the total unimpaired runoff at Friant Dam is less than 400,000 acre-feet) in a manner that improves the fishery in the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and Gravelly Ford.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to develop and implement, in cooperation with the state of California, a reasonable plan to fully recirculate, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer all such restoration flows.
