        <text>Floor summary: DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Dingell motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to require the Director of National Intelligence to share with all appropriate federal agencies all information on new and constantly changing threats used by terrorists to evade airport screening and to update the terrorist watch list. Amendment also requires the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the heads of each element of the intelligence community, to prioritize efforts and dedicate sufficient resources to uncover and foil attempts to steal the private personal information of all Americans.</text>
